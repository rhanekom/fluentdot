A fluent interface for .NET for generating graphs with [GraphViz](http://www.graphviz.org/).

FluentDot provides a fluent interface for generating graph layouts in DOT format, which in turn is consumed by GraphViz (specifically dot.exe) in order to produce graphs in various formats.

FluentDot is still early in development - there are several features that are not implemented yet, and there are some places where you can still generate invalid Dot. It's published early in it's development cycle in the hope that feedback will arrive sooner.

Please see the [samples](https://github.com/rhanekom/fluentdot/wiki) to see what's currently possible with FluentDot and GraphViz.

Note : FluentDot requires [GraphViz](http://www.graphviz.org/) to be installed.
